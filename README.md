This is my Online Portfolio.

## New version 2.0
Had made the necessary changes to make the portfolio looks like it should:
1) Have fixed the image at the top with a new one and made it responsive.
2) Made the navigation bar to, when clicked, take the user to the correct part of the portfolio.
3) Added the content of old navigation bar (email, LinkedIn and gitHub) link to the part called "Contact Information" at the bottom of the page.
