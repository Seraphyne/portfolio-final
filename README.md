# portfolio-final
This is my Online Portfolio.

## New version 2.0
Had made the necessary changes to make the portfolio looks like it should:
1) Have fixed the image at the top with a new one and made it responsive.
2) Made the navigation bar to, when clicked, take the user to the correct part of the portfolio.
3) Added the content of old navigation bar (email, LinkedIn and gitHub) link to the part called "Contact Information" at the bottom of the page.

## New version 3.o
Had made the necessary changes to make the portfolio looks like it should:
1) Took the button for resume out of navigation.
2) Fixed a typo on the About Me session.
3) Added on the About Me part which programming languages I can do.
